<p>
This event will activate the same action of the windowClosing event. If there are any changes happen after the most 
recent save operation, it will ask for you whether you want to save that. And this informationwill be sent to the other 
player and it will cause that the other player can't do any network related operations any longer. Commonly, the other 
player should also exit the game unless he or she can save the current game.
