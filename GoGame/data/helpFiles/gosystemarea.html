<h1>Go System Area</h1>
<p>
This area is constructed for network system usage and therefore is uneditable. It will report your partner's current 
state and new request. When there is a new request in this area, the agree and disagree button will be activated and, 
at the same time, the network related menus(include the NewGame menu, the ContinueGame menu and the BackAStep menu) 
are disabled. If you have any questions, you could look up the help file or contact your partner using the Go Talk 
Area which is still activated. Furthermore, you can save current status in a file when you managed to agree with your 
partner's request but don't want to lose the current game. Anyway, however, be sure to give an answer of agree or 
disagree to your partner because both your partner and the system are now waiting for you!!! What more do you want???
