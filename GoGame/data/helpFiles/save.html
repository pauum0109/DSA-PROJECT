<h1>Save A Game</h1>
<p>
You can the current game and its configuration in a go file whose postfix is .go. If the current file isn't null, 
that is to say, you have opened a go file or you have selected a file and have done a save operation, the game will 
be saved in that file. Otherwise, a save dialog will be prompted for you to select a file to save this game. You 
and/or your partner can save the game separately. The save menuitem will be activated again after you saved the game 
to a file until a new change happens.
