<h1>Connect To The Server</h1>
<p>
A Connection Dialog will be shown for you to input the server IP address (recommended) or its name, and the server's 
port number. In the case a client runs on the same machine as the server, IP 127.0.0.1 can be used for that client. 
If the Connect Button is selected, the Connection Dialog will be closed and a Wait Window will be shown. The first 
connecting party will be locked to wait the other party to log on. When both players are logged, the playing interface 
will show up. And then you can try to talk to your partner or new a game or select to continue a game.<br/><br/>
You can press the drag your mouse to move the Wait Window. And the mouse cursor will be changed when the mouse enters 
or exits the Wait Window to let you know the system is waiting for your partner's connecting.
