<h1>Back A Step</h1>
<p>
You can choose to back a playing step when you need it although it is not recommended but not always unaccecptable. 
The software will also ask for your partner's agree. Only if your partner agrees to this operation, will it be done. 
Any player can request to it and if both players agree to it, it will bring to the very beginning the game: just the 
handicapped buttons in the board and when there is no handicapped button or only one, there will be no button in the 
board at all.
