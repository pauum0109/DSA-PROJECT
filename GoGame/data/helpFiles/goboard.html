<h1>Go Board</h1>
<p>
This is the essential part of this software. If the game was already newed or continued, if it's your turn to play, 
and if your mouse is pressed in a valid area, that is to say, it's near a cross point of the board and not a point 
which can't be played at that time, a button will be added to your board and your partner's board. Otherwise, it 
will beep to told you the error. The invalid points includes two kinds of points, the "Case Died Point" or "Suicide 
Point".(It means that if this Go Button is played, it will cause either itself or a whole block of your part to die 
themselves.)
</p><p>
To be more more easily during the playing, the current point will be shown when the mouse lingers over the board. If 
current point is valid, a green rectangle will be shown. If it is invaild for current operation, a red one will be 
shown. This point-indication function is suitable not only for playing, but also for the <A HREF = "countpoints.html"> 
Counting the Points Alive </A> action.

The Go Board and whole playing interface can be resized easily unless the size was too small to let the board be shown.
