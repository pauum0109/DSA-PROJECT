<h1>How To Notify Me</h1>
<p>
It will offer three ways to let you select one which will be used to notify you if your partner choose to notify you.
The three ways are: the system beep, play a piece of music or send you an email. You must choose a music file if you 
choose the second way and you should input your email address and it's SMTP server's name in the corresponding text 
fields if you prefer to receive an email. The Preplay function will let you experience the action first.
