<h1>About The Go World (Net Version) Server</h1>
<p>
The server part is just used to let the two client parts be able to communicate with each other. The port number is
arbitrarily selected by you or your partner but be sure not to conflict with any of other processes in both of your 
computers and be sure to be the same as what will be inputed in the client parts.
