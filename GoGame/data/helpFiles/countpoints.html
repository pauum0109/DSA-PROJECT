<h1>Count Points Alive</h1>
<p>
If you decide to do this operation and it is agreed by your partner, the game will be stopped. You will be asked to 
mark the dead buttons because the software is not sure of the conditions alive of each button. Press the button and 
that block will be marked dead. You can unmark them using Control while pressing the mouse. While you end the mark, 
the system will ask for your partner's agreement. If your partner has some other ideas, he/she will remark(mark or 
unmark) them, and then system will let you know and asks for your agreement. The marking will loop again and again 
until one agrees the other person. While the mark ends, the points alive will be reported to you and your partner.
