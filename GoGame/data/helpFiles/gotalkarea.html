<h1>Go Talking Area</h1>
<p>
This is an editable area designed for you and your partner. You can input texts here to talk to your partner. Be sure to 
use your mouse to mark what you what to send or cut. When there are some selected parts, the send and cut buttons will 
be activated. What your partner sent to you is also displayed in this area. To be more clearly, the words you sent to 
your partner will be set to blue, the words your received from your partner will be set to red and the other words you 
written or pasted from the system clipboard are set to default color black. You can choose your favourite colors used to 
render the three kinds of texts. If you have just changed the color and you choose undo, however, the old color may not 
be correctly replaced. There are some more functions you can choose to use are listed on the popup menu and they are all 
the same usage as that in the other software. Please refer to the <A HREF = "popupmenu.html"> Popup Menu </A> to see 
detailed information about that.
</p><p>
You can use the "Record" function whose button is placed in the lower part. Press "Record" button and begin speaking 
something using microphone. Then "End Record" and <A HREF = "popupmenu.html#send"> "Send" </A> what you have said.
</p><p>
Be polite and consult with your partner before sending a new request although it's not compulsory. I hope your 
friendship is strengthened after the game has been played.
