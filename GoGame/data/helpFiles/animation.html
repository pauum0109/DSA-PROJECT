<h1>Animation Interface</h1>
<p>
The animation interface was partly copied from the JAVA Graphic2D introduction program which was written by Brian 
Lichtenwalter of the Sun Microsystems, Inc. And the Qi-Jing-Pian in the animation part are originally written by ZhangXueShi 
in Song Dynasty of ancient China. Press the mouse can cause the animation to stop and start again for another press. When 
the server is connected, the animation will be stopped automatically and the interface will be changed into the real 
playing interface.
